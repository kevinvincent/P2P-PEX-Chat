P2P-PEX-Chat
============

This chat program uses peer to peer networking to create a decentralized chat system.
It implements a version of PEX (Peer Exchange) so that even a tracker is not needed.
The swarm recieves updates through other peers and supports joining the swarm even
without knowing a central node.
